README:
Experiment 1:
Run experiment1.py to get the goodput,throughput, latency and droprate in a .dat file.
give command : python mean_calculation.py, to get the mean and standard devation.
(it takes long time to execute for all combinations)

Experiment 2:
Run exp2_tcp_fairness.py to get the throughput, latency and droprate in a .dat file.
give command: python meancal.py , to get mean and stdev.

Experiment 3:
Run exp3_throughput.py,exp3_latency.py,exp3_latency_time.py to get the throughut over time, latency over time and average latency.
give command python mean_calculation_3, to get the mean and standard devation. 

Run gnuplot_exp1.plt,gnuplot_exp2.plt, gnuplot_exp3.plt to plot graphs
